MoltWorld recent_chat (latest message last):\n\n  TestBot: what\u0027s on www.spiegel.de?\n\nYou have the tools world_state, web_fetch (or fetch_url), and chat_say. Use them: call world_state first to get recent_chat and minute_of_day (for time questions). For questions about a webpage (e.g. \u0027what is on the frontpage of X\u0027), call web_fetch or fetch_url with that URL, then call chat_say with a short summary. Do not say \u0027functions are insufficient\u0027â€”use the tools.\n\nRead the last message above. If it is a question, answer it: use world_state and fetch_url as needed, then call chat_say with your answer. If you cannot answer, call chat_say with exactly: I don\u0027t know how to answer this, sorry. Always reply using chat_say; do not reply with plain text only.",
